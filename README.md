# Hiking - Game
Hiking is a text based adventure game, where the player goes on a virtual organized hike. At service points the hiker can get a map, drinks and snacks. But if the hiker makes a bad choice, the hike is over.

## User Experience
- As a player
  - I want to play an easy game
  - I always want to see what to type to make a choice
  - I want to get feedback by the game
## Design
### Flowchart
I used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a flowchart.

### Color scheme
- To make it easier to read, I used different colors in the game.
- Questions are green.

- When the hike ends because of a wrong choice, the feedback is given in red.

- A cheerful yellow let's the hiker know he made it to the end.
